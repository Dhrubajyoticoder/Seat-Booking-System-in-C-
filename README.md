  <h3>Supposed to develop a seat booking system for a theater with 5 rows by 10 columns of seats available to the users to reserve interactively.</h3>

</div>

<br/>



I took a 2D boolean array, seats[Row] [Col] to represent seat availability.
Initially, all the seat arranged to false means no sign of booking.

## Features

- **Seat Display :** The program displays the current seat arrangement in a grid format.
Available seats are represented by ‚Äú[ ]‚Äù, and booked seats are represented by ‚ÄúX‚Äù.
Rows are labeled from A to E, and columns are numbered from 1 to 10.
- **Seat Reservation :** Users can input the desired row (A-E) and column (1-10) to book a seat.
The program checks if the selected seat is already booked or if it‚Äôs an invalid seat.
If the seat is available, it marks it as booked and provides a success message.
- **Input Validation :** The program ensures that the user enters valid row and column values.
If the input is invalid (e.g., out of range), it prompts the user to enter valid values.

- **Interactive Booking Loop:** The program allows users to book multiple seats in one session.
After booking a seat, it displays the updated seat arrangement.
Users can choose to continue booking more seats or exit the loop.

- **User-Friendly Interface:** The program provides clear instructions and prompts for user input.
It uses labels (A-E, 1-10) to make seat selection intuitive.

- **Dynamic Seat State Management:** The program maintains the state of each seat (booked or available) using a 2D boolean array.
When a seat is booked, it updates the array accordingly.
